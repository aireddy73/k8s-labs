Scenario 9) Users management, RBAC
- Use 9-sum.sh bash script which will:
  -  apply 9-users.yaml
    - To generate myapp namespace, ClusterRole named developer and RoleBinding of group developers to ClusterRole developer within namespace myapp
  - Create local system user and proper certificates using ‘kubeadm alpha kubeconfig user’. This user is only available on master node, and has password of r00tme.
    You can ssh to master node also as this user.
- From now on all task should be performed as dev user, and only specific actions should be performed by admin
