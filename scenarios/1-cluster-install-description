Scenario 1A) Prepare VMs
- Prepare lab environment using Vagrant and Vagrantfile available here:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiewioras/k8s-labs/master/Vagrantfile 
- Vagrant will provide following VMs with 2Gigs of memory and 2vCPUs
- Proper internal networks will also be created and VMs will be accessible via following IPs:
  - 10.5.7.10 - Master Node with SSH keys for access to workers
  - 10.5.7.11 & .12 - worker1 and worker2
  - root user with password r00tme can be used to access the nodes
- All nodes have /etc/hosts file properly populated, and all needed packages installed and bash completion enabled for kubectl
- Following repo will be downloaded: https://github.com/wiewioras/k8s-labs on master node
- For more details see Vagrantfile

Scenario 1B) Deploy kubernetes cluster
- To deploy cluster use /root/init.sh script. 
- Why you need to use apiserver-advertise-address with kubeadm init command?
- Why there is calico.patch?
- Use kubeadm join command returned by kubeadm on worker nodes to configure workers
- Make sure that cluster is working properly (kubectl get nodes)
