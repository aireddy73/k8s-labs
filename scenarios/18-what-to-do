Take 17-sum.yaml and figure out how to:
1) Deploy it as dedicated user
2) Use namespaces
3) Configure ingress controller to handle our two nginx URLs
4) Assign network policies to each pod - make only required traffic possible
5) Deploy application two times in separate namespaces, with different labels (dev/prod?) and play with rollout command
6) Scale your application
7) Deploy NFS server (package on top of master node, or maybe control-plane pod?)
8) Play with nginx so it will use NFS share for e.g. logs. Create Additional container in nginx pod which will read the NFS share and expose logs somehow


What was not covered:
1) DNS
2) flanneld
3) calico
